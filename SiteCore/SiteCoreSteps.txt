PreRequisites for Installing SiteCore Instance:

[1] - URL Rewrite 2.1 (https://www.iis.net/downloads/microsoft/url-rewrite)
[2] - Microsoft Web Deploy 3.6 for hosting servers (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=43717)
[3] - Microsoft® SQL Server® Data-Tier Application Framework (17.1 DacFx) - (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=55255)
[4] - Apache Solr (v6.6.1) from http://archive.apache.org/dist/lucene/solr/6.6.1/ - (Here are the steps:)
		* Download the solr-6.6.1.zip and unzip on your local C: dir
		* For Solr, we'll need to set up JRE as well (Env variable JAVA_HOME)
		* Set up SSL for Solr: Steps provided at: https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/6_6/enabling-ssl.html
			> install openssl from: https://code.google.com/archive/p/openssl-for-windows/downloads
			> Unzip and copy all the files in the bin folder including openssl.exe(All file of bin folder) 
			> Goto to the folder where you installed JDK for me it’s C:\Program Files\Java\jdk.<version>\bin 
			> Paste all the files you copied from Openssl’s bin folder to the Jdk folder. Try "openssl -v" and see if it provides you with its version
			> Create a new Folder under C: dir named "SiteCoreResources". This is where we'll keep all of our SSL certificates as well as SiteCore resources
			  so open cmd and do a "C:\SiteCoreResources"
			> Run the following command: (Remember to customize the YOUR_MACHINE_IP_ADDR with your machine's IP Address. This is the local system's IP that 
			  solr is supposed to be running on) - Running this command should give us a "solr-ssl.keystore.jks" file
			  
			  keytool -genkeypair -alias solr-ssl -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -keypass secret -storepass secret -validity 9999 -keystore solr-ssl.keystore.jks -ext SAN=DNS:localhost,IP:<YOUR_MACHINE_IP_ADDR>,IP:127.0.0.1 -dname "CN=localhost, OU=Organizational Unit, O=Organization, L=Location, ST=State, C=Country"
			
			> Run the following command: (Make sure to provide pass "secret" for all prompts) - We'll get a file called "solr-ssl.keystore.p12"
			
			  keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore solr-ssl.keystore.jks -destkeystore solr-ssl.keystore.p12 -srcstoretype jks -deststoretype pkcs12
			
			> Run the following command to get a .pem file. (Provide 'secret' as passwords on every prompt.)
			
			  openssl pkcs12 -in solr-ssl.keystore.p12 -out solr-ssl.pem
			
			> Now copy all of these three files ("solr-ssl.pem", "solr-ssl.keystore.jks", "solr-ssl.keystore.p12") to  "C:\solr-6.6.1\bin\etc" and double click 
			  and install file "solr-ssl.keystore.p12"
			  
		* Now we need to Edit the "C:\solr-6.6.1\bin\solr.in.cmd" file to make sure it runs as a service. Open the file by clicking edit and search for: 
		  "REM set SOLR_SSL_KEY_STORE". Make sure the settings looks like:
			
			set SOLR_SSL_KEY_STORE=etc/solr-ssl.keystore.jks
			set SOLR_SSL_KEY_STORE_PASSWORD=secret
			set SOLR_SSL_TRUST_STORE=etc/solr-ssl.keystore.jks
			set SOLR_SSL_TRUST_STORE_PASSWORD=secret
			REM Require clients to authenticate
			set SOLR_SSL_NEED_CLIENT_AUTH=false
			REM Enable clients to authenticate (but not require)
			set SOLR_SSL_WANT_CLIENT_AUTH=false
		
		* We can now test the env by starting solr. We can do that by executing "solr start" on cmd. (if "solr" is not recognized, update the PATH system env
		  variable and append the SOLR\bin path to it)
