To configure Solr as a Windows Service, use NSSM. (https://nssm.cc/)

- Download the NSSM app from: https://nssm.cc/download
- Extract to a location i.e. C:\nssm-2.24
- Open CMD, and execute:
	"C:\nssm-2.24\win64\nssm" install solr6
- A NSSM Service installer popup window will appear with options such as Path, Startup Dir and Arguments.
- For the "Path" field, we need to provide the URL for Solr.cmd, its "C:\solr-6.6.1\bin\solr.cmd" in my case.
- Set "Arguments" to be "start -f -p 8983" (-f means to run Solr in foreground, -p 8983 specified the port)
- Click "Install Service"
