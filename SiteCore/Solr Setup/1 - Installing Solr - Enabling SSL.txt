PreRequisites for Installing SiteCore Instance:

[1] - URL Rewrite 2.1 (https://www.iis.net/downloads/microsoft/url-rewrite)
[2] - Microsoft Web Deploy 3.6 for hosting servers (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=43717)
[3] - Microsoft® SQL Server® Data-Tier Application Framework (17.1 DacFx) - (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=55255)
[4] - Apache Solr (v6.6.1) from http://archive.apache.org/dist/lucene/solr/6.6.1/ - (Here are the steps:)
		* Download the solr-6.6.1.zip and unzip on your local C: dir
		* For Solr, we'll need to set up JRE as well (Env variable JAVA_HOME)
		* Set up SSL for Solr: Steps provided at: https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/6_6/enabling-ssl.html
			> install openssl from: https://code.google.com/archive/p/openssl-for-windows/downloads
			> Unzip and copy all the files in the bin folder including openssl.exe(All file of bin folder) 
			> Goto to the folder where you installed JDK for me it’s C:\Program Files\Java\jdk.<version>\bin 
			> Paste all the files you copied from Openssl’s bin folder to the Jdk folder. Try "openssl -v" and see if it provides you with its version
			> Follow the instructions on: https://www.oshyn.com/blogs/2017/november/how-to-install-solr-with-ssl-on-windows-10
			> Run the following command on a Powershell window: 
				
			  New-SelfSignedCertificate -CertStoreLocation cert:\LocalMachine\My -DnsName "localhost", "127.0.0.1" -FriendlyName "SolrCert" -NotAfter (Get-Date).AddYears(10)
			
			> Search for "Manage computer certificates" on Win10. Click on "Personal" option from the left Pane, then "Certificates" on the right pane, you'll notice a newly added cert there
			  with a friendly name "SolrCert"
			  
			> Right click on the newly created cert and copy it to the "Trusted Root Certification Authorities/Certificates" 
			
			> Now export the SolrCert with the following options:
				- "Yes, export the private key", Click Next
				- Check only "Include all certificates in the certification path if possible" option and click next
				- Provide a password ("secret" in this case)
				
			> Export the cert to a desired location named "solr_ssl_cert.pfx"
			
		* Now we need to Edit the "C:\solr-6.6.1\bin\solr.in.cmd" file to make sure it runs as a service. Open the file by clicking edit and search for: 
		  "REM set SOLR_SSL_KEY_STORE". Make sure the settings looks like:
			
			set SOLR_SSL_KEY_STORE=C:/apache/solr_ssl_cert.pfx
			set SOLR_SSL_KEY_STORE_PASSWORD=secret
			set SOLR_SSL_KEY_STORE_TYPE=PKCS12
			set SOLR_SSL_TRUST_STORE=C:/apache/solr_ssl_cert.pfx
			set SOLR_SSL_TRUST_STORE_PASSWORD=secret
			set SOLR_SSL_TRUST_STORE_TYPE=PKCS12
		
		* We can now test the env by starting solr. We can do that by executing "solr start" on cmd. (if "solr" is not recognized, update the PATH system env
		  variable and append the SOLR\bin path to it)
